# Material Palenight Theme for Notepad++
After years of loving the Palenight themes developed for other IDEs such as PhpStorm and VSCode, I felt Notepad++ https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus was missing out.


![Demo of Palenight for Notepad++](https://github.com/SamSebastien/material-palenight-npp/blob/master/palenight-preview.jpg?raw=true)


### Installation

* Close Notepad++
* Download the `Material Palenight.xml` file to your desktop.
* Copy the downloaded file to `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Notepad++\themes`
* Open Notepad++ and select the theme from `Settings > Style Configurator`
* Optional: If you want to use the `JetBrains Mono` font set in the theme download from: https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono

### Completed Styles

Most langauges should look good (given the styling limitations of NPP compared to more extensible IDEs), but the following have been specifically worked to look like the Palenight implementations on other IDEs.

If you find something looking off in another langauge let me know or PR so it can be updated.

1. PHP
2. Javascript
3. HTML
4. JSON
5. Bash
6. XML
7. YAML
